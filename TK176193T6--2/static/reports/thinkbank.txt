ThinkBank is a robust platform designed for managing and sharing research abstracts. In this system, administrators can upload PDF abstracts directly into the database, creating a centralized repository of scholarly works. Users can register and log in to the platform, enabling them to submit their own PDF abstracts. Upon submission, the system compares the new abstract with existing entries to ensure originality. If the content similarity is less than 30%, the abstract is accepted and uploaded to the database; otherwise, users receive a failure message indicating that their submission is too similar to existing documents. This functionality promotes academic integrity while facilitating knowledge sharing within the community.
